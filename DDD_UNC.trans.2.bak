Light, while shimmering with the currents of water, pours down on me and the stone room I'm in. Inside the clear blueness, the current in the ocean above my head violently swooshed as the outline of an enormous fish passed.":456,"The figure of the fish brushes against the light. Its body length is a little more than two meters. ":457,"Though first off, I can't tell if that even is a fish. Even then, I don't know what kind of fish it is, if I had to go by just the silhouette, it's a shark. If somebody asked me if sharks can live in fresh water, I'd have to pause a bit.":458,"The shadow distances itself. Probably because it didn't like me looking at it, the fish went higher...deeper into the ocean and disappeared":459,"Felt like the sky and the ground were reversed. But I'm used to it. No problem. That's a glass ceiling and above it is a huge water \ntank.":460,"Nah, a little different from that. The room I'm in is underneath a huge water tank, would be the correct way of describing it. I'm just in an underground chamber and the ocean above my head really isn't the ocean, but just an old storage tank.":461,"This crazy water tank ceilinged chamber is an anachronism that might as well be a room taken straight out of a medieval castle, you see.

In fact, it'd been lost so completely and perfectly that it left people baffled about just what one has to do to remove it so cleanly.":488,"Luckily, the only thing I lost was that and there hadn't been any danger to my life. One and a half years of rehabilitation and I got discharged.":489,"Pain in the ass for job searching and socializing, but nope, no dissatisfactions with the one-armed me.

What was that about?\"":497,"\"What, like the feeling that I'd been movie hopping theaters for the lousy late night showings. ...Oh wait, you wouldn't get that.\"":498,"\"Nope, can't say I can identify with that. I've never been to a theater before. Besides, is there even such a thing as an entertaining late night show?\"":499,"Golly, why yes, there are, a whole lot. The fool has the idea that a late night showing is the act of shitting out third-rate movies that can only be shown in the middle of the night.":500,"I'll let you know that nowadays, late night showings are better for actually enjoying movies, okay?":501,"...But no point in explaining this to someone who doesn't understand the fundamentals of movies.":502,"\"Sorry, bad example.

Hours of seeing something like that does stir up my curiosity. T'was quite the mystery as to how you could manage to sleep the entire time in such agony.\"":512,"He asks me in amusement. He's bored all year long so he's voracious for anything interesting.":513,"\"...Look, I already told you, it was a nasty dream. I'm still feeling nauseous here and the last thing I need is to remember it. I was about to die in it.\"":514,"Well actually, I definitely did die back there. My neck was twisted after all.":515,"\"Oh, you saw a dream where you were about to die? Ah, so that's why you were screaming things like 'Oh help' or 'Please stop for the love of [GOD]!'. Oh poo. There would have been real entertainment if you'd only slept a little longer.\"":516,"Is that supposed to mean you wanted to hear my death scream.":517,"\"You're sick. If you see me groaning, wake me up dammit. What, you enjoy seeing people suffer? Do you get turned on by the panting of men?\"":518,"\"Mmmm, it depends, but yours, {i}[Arika]{/i}, was quite the treat, you know? I don't know what happened to you, but it was a disconnected and interesting jumble of somniloquy.\"":519,"\"Oh, but that demonstration of your shameless and wonderful true colors was more than appetizing enough.\"":520,"The punk then thanks me for the meal and smiles happily.":521,"...Oh snap. I just had to get charmed by that. I don't want to admit it, but it's attractive. It's the ultimate smile. If you're a man, you can't resist it. The truth is I hate the guy, but I love his smile. One day, this dilemma must be resolved.":522,"\"Sigh, oh yeah, what a riot. Gee, depending on how I think about it, I've been raped for two hours? You sadistic shit and your twisted denial play.

I guess it's expensive? Not really something you could put a price on. ":525,"\"I should be the one saying that. {i}[Arika]{/i}, your day hours are running on my money.

That was the predicament of the life of [Karyou] {i}[Kaie]{/i}. He can't leave this room. No, he can't even get up from the bed without help.":529,"There's a simple reason for that. All of {i}[Kaie]'s{/i} limbs are \nartificial.":530,"[GOD] is cruel.":531,"After all, he not only gave {i}[Kaie]{/i} a face that couldn't be any prettier, he gave him a body that couldn't be any more restricting.

Taking money from a kid that can't move by himself? That's worse than being a gigolo.":534,"Then again, this leader of the forces of darkness was born in a wealthy family and him paying me was something of a pastime to him, apparently.":535,"{i}[Kaie]{/i} himself isn't going to have any problems with any of the basic necessities for the rest of his life, plus he's got prosthetics that fit him perfectly.":536,"As long as he wears them, he can do most things. On the first day of work, he just leisurely walked to the bathroom with his prosthetic legs. Yep, that's {i}[Kaie]{/i}-chan, the rich kid with the awesome prosthetics, but performance and comfort are two different things.":537,"Seems that no matter what, prosthetics just don't go well with {i}[Kaie]{/i}, so most of the time he's lying on the bed like he is now.":538,"Yeah, prosthetics are at any rate, stifling and painful. {i}[Kaie]{/i} only has his left leg and right arm on at the moment, probably because he's not in good shape today. Meaning that──":539,"I probe the corner of the room....found it. The black dog's crouching at the corner of the room. Has the appearance of a monster from a picture book.

He laughs with a crescent moon grin under the shadow of the canopy. There's really something seriously rotten with him if he could still sit back and watch my groaning after knowing that much.":556,"In the first place, the reason why I got into that mess was largely related to him.":557,"I should have quit. Just because I could make money on it, I wasn't suited for that work. 'I want to live as easily as possible' is [Arika] [Ishizue]'s policy, his ideal principle, his rebirth slogan.":558,"And I ignored that and dug myself into a grave.":559,"On that night... in that nightmare I don't want to ever have anything to do with again, I stepped right inside that grave.":560,"The house where there had been a family suicide, a freakish neck-rotating man.":561,"The epidemic of demon possession I said I never wanted to see again.":562,"It first became known to the public about 10 years ago, or so they say.":563,"Agonist Disorder, a sudden psychological disorder that's also been described as a receptor crash.":564,"It's treated as being one of the modern-day illnesses, such as depression and TKS, but probably the only people who know it by that name are the ones involved.":565,"Anyhow, it refers to those psychologically crippled that are unable to control their own emotions. It's a name with only symptoms and no pathogens, so you might think, y'all don't be inventing some disease when you're just loony.":566,"But don't do that. Depression after all is a real mental 'illness'. Illnesses will infect even a healthy cold-proof body using their bags of tricks.":567,"If the stuff in someone's head becomes 'off' in comparison with everyone else, it's not because the mind's sick, it's because there is something wrong in the body. Human beings are made up of mystery, wonder, and a solid design schematic.":568,"Breakdowns don't occur for no reason.":569,"However, the only people that recognize it as a disease are the experts. The public generally calls those affected by it the 'demon possessed.'":570,"Why? Well, that'd be because they exhibit behavior that'd lead one to conclude they're possessed by demons. Personality transformation and breakdown are only light conditions.":571,"Severe cases go from obsessive-compulsive, self-inflicted harm and suicide attempts to discharging of hostility towards surroundings. To get straight to the point, it gives birth to criminals that inflict harm on others based on trivial emotions.":572,"\"But, I mean, that's not even demon possession, is it? It's just a flashy, but still normal, disease. Why use some anachronistic word like 'demon?'\"":573,"\"Because the words 'demon possession' are easier to understand, I guess? Depression just won't ring a bell for normal people, let alone the ones that actually saw them. But the image of 'demon possession' fits easily.":574,"People can accept the bizarre utterances that are made if it's because a demon's responsible for them. If there's a demon inside, that'd account for their nearly non-human behavior, too, from their point of view.":575,"Still, ego transference to an artificial personality coming from that type of possession state died out a long time ago. I'll add that the personas that the people in this country wear are generally going to be that of beasts too.":576,"Demons are spirits that, well, simply {i}don't{/i} appear in Japan.\"":577,"Yeah, demon possession was originally nonsense talk from our pals outside this island. Theirs work on the basis of 1 to 6 billion, with Team [GOD] (1) getting the absolute advantage.":578,"In turn of the century Japan, demons are a concept that can only live in a religion with just one [GOD].":579,"\"Pathetic. If they have to use something, they could have picked Inugami possession. More familiar and more established, that's my opinion on it.\"":580,"\"Nah, it might be easy to understand, but it mustn't feel established. No matter how much faith has died out over here, the Japanese are still Japanese.":581,"We're going to be sensitive to the words 'beast possession' in one way or another, but with demon possession, it's more distant, more game-like.":582,"Wouldn't you think that it'd be both strangely realistic as well as boring if it was only a disease that had already been in this country?\"":583,"\"Ah... so, what, 'demon possession' is more convenient for us?\"":584,"\"Yes, yes. That's why I think the demon possession that's going around now is a modern-day sickness. There is an ending in sight, but since it isn't coming at all, everybody's building up a lot of stress.":585,"You could fall apart any day, the people around you could break any day - you'd feel secure thinking that way wouldn't you, that you're safe because you're ready for self-ruin? I guess people are numbing themselves with a defensive screen that's giving them that kind of mistaken thinking.":586,"It's the current fad to become obtuse along with everybody else. The words 'demon possession' are just being used by that tide. Just as the name suggests, it's the perfect sacrifice to lay the blame.\"":587,"Self-poisoning, self-generation, self-ruin, huh. Oh, you precocious little punk, if that's true, then demon possession's only a phenomenon and not even a sickness. You make it sound like it'll be replaced by a new fad word after a year.":588,"But, the big problem isn't in the theoretical. It's that it causes real harm. Demon possession does exist. The people that have it really are mentally ill. And, they are 'super humans' like Kizaki that threw away their humanity.":589,"These last few years, the number of abnormal crimes has been increasing. Most of the time, these incidents are passed off as being just another demon possession crime.":590,"But among these, only around 100 were processed as crimes by the demon possessed. This doesn't account for even 10 percent of the total number of abnormal crimes.":591,"\"That's why you mix 10 truths into 100 lies. Do that and both of them become lies.\"":592,"Well said. Even if someone has the misfortune of running into an incident like the Kizaki one, since the other 9 are normal 'abnormal crimes', it will be categorized as a 'suspicious but abnormal \ncrime'.":593,"The public might be aware of demon possessions, but they're totally unaware, under the real meaning, of what demon possession is.":594,"A part of the reason why the name demon possession stuck. It isn't because of the incomprehensible behavior of those afflicted. It is simply because they exerted abilities that humans don't have.":595,"There are things that don't escape from the realm of delusion, as well as things that are treated on the same level as mental defects. However, there are cases where it crosses that line and becomes 'super human'.":596,"Like say, a human that doesn't die when he rotates his head and, on top of that, hurts other people. But yeah, I suppose it is natural for people to think that's impossible unless a contract with the devil's been made.":597,"...Seriously, how damn stupid. In the age where excess civilization supply has ended, what the hell are demons? I don't buy it.":598,"I've seen people that can't be interpreted as being anything else other than people really possessed by demons, and I still can't buy it. Normal people must not accept these things as real even if they are true.":599,"I still can't acknowledge them and I probably never will for the rest of my life. Even if 100 Kizakis come after me, I will stubbornly laugh them off.":600,"...Still, there is something preventing me from dismissing it as nonsense. There is a reason why I, despite being able to write it off as lies, can't quash it as false.":601,"The reason──is because the punk in front of me, is not some demon possessed douche, but a real demon.":602,"\"Say. What's the border between real and fake?\"":603,"\"Hmm? Border?\"":604,"\"I'm talking about demon possession. The difference between someone that's really possessed and someone that isn't, the difference between a normal sickness and an abnormal sickness?\"":605,"I recall that incident a month ago at that house three buildings away from mine. The neck cramp I got from sleeping the wrong way aches. Yeah, that was-how'd I finish that anyway?":606,"\"Mmmm... you mean whether what's possessing them is real or not?\"":607,"\"No, not that. I had enough of the demonology sermon. I don't care about the truth of the current demon epidemic. I'm asking why people get possessed by demons.\"":608,"\"Huh? How dull. It should be obvious. Whether real or fake, a demon's going to possess a particular type of person. Those guys have been fond of the emotionally weak for quite the time.\"":609,"\"Excuse me? Don't you have that backwards? Your mind gets sick after you get demon possession. Didn't you say that demon possession is an illness?\"":610,"\"Look, if you put real thought to it, you will get it. An epidemic infects people with low immunity, yes? The physically weak or the physically unfit are easily susceptible to external illnesses.":611,"If the body works that way, then so does the mind. {i}[Arika]{/i}, when it comes down to it, you're a kind person. I know you can't tolerate it when the weak are pushed around for being weak, but this is a fact. Demons only possess people that had already been weak.\"":612,"He says this with a smug face. What I hate about him is this part. Just quit it with the character beautification.":613,"\"What...? You're saying, demon possession is their own fault? Not even counting physical build and fitness, people with a fundamental personality weakness are bound to become possessed?\"":614,"\"Yes, weak people will be hit by demon possession. But that isn't because they're emotionally weak, but rather, the 'environment' around them has weakened. Even if the heart lies in the inside, it fluctuates according to external factors.":615,"Family issues; relationship with the friends, the Other; evaluation of Self in society. If the footing is poisoned, naturally, the person standing on it'll also be infected.":616,"The mind then becomes sickened and that person becomes unable to adapt to normal society. This is an example of the environment not being built by us, but changing us.":617,"And taking of advantage of that, the supernatural infests the just-weakened mind.\"":618,"\"You see, the concept of demons is the affirmation of weakness. They're using that weakness as a breeding ground, so they're going to be fostering that weakness with all their might.":619,"They'll completely to destroy the host's sociality, something they had merely lost sight of. Let's say that there's someone who says he can't continue living without his girlfriend. This is just a preventive measure to deal with their pessimism, but with demon possession, they'll actually commit suicide.":620,"'I'm sad so I want to die, but I'm scared of death.' That's the balance of a normal person. But these people are different. 'I've had enough of feeling sad, so I have to die.' There is a total lack of fear of the future.":621,"The really scary people are the ones that no longer care about their past and future and can only see 'the present.'\"":622,"\"...Can only see the present, huh? If people don't think about tomorrow, that leaves everything up for grabs. If there's only a today, then it's fine to do anything in the present.\"":623,"Which would mean dying tomorrow isn't anything to get all upset about. If there's anything they're scared of, it's being anything but what they are in the present. ":624,"\"So while us normal people have hesitations towards dying and anger at living, they're the opposite?\"":625,"\"Yes, that's right. For people with nothing but the present, it's as if they'd just been born. They'll feel that everything around them is tinged with uncertainty. It's not as if they can't put the brakes on their emotions.":626,"People with emotional wounds, people that are liable to be possessed by concepts, are living beings that really can't go on living without a 'rule they judged for themselves.'":627,"Emotions won't break them, but they'll destroy themselves just by breaking a delicate rule that holds no meaning to anyone but themselves. It's easy for the supernatural to take hold in a heart on the brink.\"":628,"\"....\"":629,"The hell. After coming up with that kind of stupid rule, they get possessed by a demon when they break it, then turn into mass-murderers?":630,"Give me a break. If you want to die, die by your damn self. Don't take your friends and family with you.":631,"\"──Damn stupid. So what it amounts to is the whining of the socially inept? Right, right no way in hell I can figure that out.":632,"Like hell am I ever going to understand the feelings of some flake that gets driven into a corner by that kind of garbage.\"":633,"Displeased at something, the face reflecting in the mirror twists in hatred. Must have been because of some nasty stench. The black dog comes by me and crouches in content. The dog's getting friendlier with me by the day. Uh oh.":634,"\"Haha, of course you wouldn't. That's how normal people think after all. But just hear me out. In this case, you don't blame the weakness of the heart, but you should think about what made it weak.\"":635,"\"This is how the stock phrase should be. It won't be, 'Feel shame in the weakness of your fragile heart!'. It'll be, 'Know the sorrow of the fragility of man!'\"":636,"{i}[Kaie]{/i} talks as if to pity them. He spreads his hand in exaggeration under the shadow of the canopy ever so courteously. But it's nothing more than a gesture. He doesn't possess the natural emotion of being able to feel sorrow.":637,"But, I understood what he was saying in a way. Let's say. Let's say, there's this guy who was hopelessly afraid of tap water and thought he'd die if he drank it.":638,"Out of some mistake, he accidentally drinks the tap water and then commits suicide, even though nothing unusual happened to his body. Saying that's weak is the vanity of the strong.":639,"After all, I don't have the courage to die just from drinking water.

So, someone who just happened to be around the area recorded this while hiding, huh. But wow, it's amazing what advances have been made in cell phones.\"":869,"You could say that they're the natural enemies of spontaneous criminal offenders. The materials that could be investigated range from phones to recorded footage, and up to the Internet.":870,"The phrase 'isolated area' really looks like it will go extinct pretty soon.":871,"\"No. It seemed that the person who took this video had been after {i}[Yukio]{/i} specifically. Something like, 'I'll expose the rumored demon possession, so let's all capture him.'\"":872,"\"....That's a unique hobby. No money coming from catching a sick man, though.\"":873,"\"It's not that. None of them care about money or justice. They're just jumping onto the bandwagon because it happens to be the most interesting rumor.\"":874,"That's it?

As a reward, I'll walk you back home tonight.":878,"\"Hey, Sempaaai. So in the end, just what is demon possession? Everybody's saying that it's depression, but do people kill dogs when they get depressed, I wonder? Hm.\"":879,"The vapid question echoes in the empty road.":880,"{i}[Tsuranui]{/i}'s apartment lies at the end of the manufacturing district, completely in the opposite direction of where my apartment is. It used to be a women's dormitory for a bread factory. The rent's ridiculously cheap.":881,"\"Sempai's a specialist, no? Please gimme your expert medical diagnosis. I, want to know the truth. I asked Dad, but he keeps brushing me off with the line that it's only a mental disorder.\"":882,"She's either not happy about being ignored by her old man or she doesn't like irresponsible rumors.":883,"{i}[Tsuranui]{/i}, who only knows about demon possession from rumors, is asking me a normal question for a normal person. But, I don't have an answer, either.":884,"\"I don't know. Next time, I'll ask someone who might know.\"":885,"\"Oh, {i}[Kaie]{/i}-san? Okay, that's okay, but I still want to hear Sempai's opinion. Like, oh, what's the cause for sudden depression.\"":886,"\"Sigh, drunks......Well, yeah. There's stuff like bad atmosphere. Ominous premonitions, feelings like there's something in the dark, etc. That's the material that the demon possession talked about in society is made of.\"":887,"\"Hm, hm, bad atmosphere you say. Like awkward situations or like say murderous intent that's popped up between me and Sempai right now?\"":888,"\"No. In that case, it's the mood itself that's giving off those vibes. I'm talking about smog, stuff you run into sometimes when you're walking on the street. Like, faint trembles in the air.":889,"If you pass by it without noticing it, you'll become irritated or depressed for no reason. Basically, you meaninglessly snap.\"":890,"\"....Huh. So that weird air is what causes demon possession? Um, the sour moments when you and {i}[Kaie]{/i}-san fight are different, right?\"":891,"\"Right. And I'll have you know that every moment between me and him is sour. Also..\"":892,"Using the example I gave, the materials for demon possession aren't in that chamber.":893,"The atmosphere there is too beautiful. Because it's disconnected from the outside world, there's no space for pollution to enter. Before, I told him it was beautiful, but {i}[Kaie]{/i} denied that while laughing.":894,"{i}\"Saying this is beautiful because it's not dirty is dead wrong. This is all there is to my world. It's nothing more than clean, because it doesn't know of filth and ugliness. You don't call that beautiful. It's only emptiness.\"{/i}":895,"....In other words, humans finally become adults by having both purity and impurity. No matter how beautiful they may be, somebody that only has purity is going to be 'alien', not human.":896,"\"Sempai? Your face is looking scary. I didn't hit a sore spot, did I?\"":897,"\"No, nothing to do with you. Don't mind me.\"":898,"While pulling the hand of the drunk, I pass by a large scale building.":899,"Still, the more I walk, the more I run into factories. The pack of factories using up the land extravagantly, the privilege of the country, ought to look like a military base up from above.":900,"\"──Ah.\"":901,"Along the way, I spotted an odd factory. The building had an awfully organic look to it. It was a factory in the process of rotting, in which the tinge of the walls and the rust on the steel fence convey images of death.":902,"\"{i}[Tsuranui]{/i}. Do you know anything about that factory over there?\"":903,"\"What? Oh, oh, that's a poultry plant. It was shut down this \nspring.\"":904,"\"A poultry plant in the middle of the manufacturing district? Is that supposed to be a metaphor?\"":905,"\"No, it really was a poultry plant. The one next to it is a bread factory, and beyond it are fields, so I think it works, environmentally speaking. But it was shut down because of the virus and then became a can factory.\"":906,"\"A can factory? But isn't it abandoned, I mean, {i}really abandoned{/i}?\"":907,"\"It is abandoned, isn't it. Anyway, no one's working there. There had been plans to convert it into a can factory, but the funding went dry eventually, so it was left like that.":908,"I heard that the household of the one in charge hung themselves. Now they're looking for the next lessee.\"":909,"\"Life's a bitch.\"":910,"\"By the way, {i}[Tsuranui]{/i}, about that video. Think you might know where it was taken? If it was uploaded for fun, there should have been something about where it was taken.\"":911,"\"Mmmm, that's true, but.. that one was a copy of a copy. I don't know who took it. Nobody really cares about where that place was. They just treat it as something to laugh at too.\"":912,"\"Is that so. And you don't recognize it?\"":913,"\"Nope. Even though this is Shikura City, it's still a big place. I don't go to stores in the alleys that much either. Sempai, have you seen it before?\"":914,"Oh, my aching head. If you live around this area, you should as hell be able to notice.":915,"We part ways in front of the apartment. Being a former girl's dormitory, {i}[Tsuranui]{/i}'s apartment was off limits to the male gender. {i}[Tsuranui]{/i} is frowning, maybe because the alcohol's still in her system.":916,"\"Are you going to be okay? If you're feeling sick, go back to your room and throw up.\"":917,"\"Ugh, I don't feel sick. It's been a while since I was sent back home by you Sempai, so I'm so happy I can't sleep, no, I'm so happy I think I'll die.\"":918,"Didn't need to worry.":919,"\"Yeah, die, die. See you later. Don't stay up late.\"":920,"\"O-kay. Let's eat together tomorrow too!\"":921,"I confirm that {i}[Tsuranui]{/i} returned to her room, then walk forward. Now then. Before I go back home, I'll take a little detour.":922,"Mikishiro Water Shikura Plant #2.":923,"That was the name of the abandoned can factory. Though, even though I say abandoned, it hadn't even gotten past the starting line. It was only a wreck that had been abandoned in the preparatory phase.":924,"The two building factory is vacant. Kind of like an empty box, and desolate. There isn't a vestige of the time it had been a poultry plant nor any automations for mass producing tin cans.":925,"What's suspicious is the three-story company building. The windows are closed from the inside by veneer boards or something.":926,"The stains on the window and the drifting air are utterly rejecting the presence of people. It's as if it was a can packed with something fiendish inside.":927,"The front entrance was locked, but I was able to get inside without difficulty since the back door was broken. Pitch black, tepid atmosphere. I'm used to both, so I had proceeded inside without a care.":928,"Making noise, I walk down the concrete hall. No light is leaking through the seams of the windows because the sky is cloudy. One inch ahead is darkness and I can't even make out the contour of the hallway.":929,"But regardless of that and without hesitation, I'm able to walk forward because this building feels familiar to me.":930,"\"Tch.... I must have come here during the day.\"":931,"The further I walk, the filthier the air becomes. There's a terribly rotten stench, probably from water leaking somewhere.":932,"This'd be the part where a normal person with a normal imagination would start to become a little scared and hesitate. But, too bad for me, the workings of the stuff inside my head aren't normal.":933,"...A healthy mind resides in a healthy body. It's a stupid phrase, but it's on the mark in a way. At the very least, it's a fact that I can't deny.":934,"Two years ago. When I lost my left arm, I stopped feeling threatened by things.":935,"The body and the mind have the same form. Does losing part of the body also cause some emotions to go away? Oddly enough, with the loss of my left arm, a part of my soul had disappeared.":936,"....Let's say, there's this person that loses his ear in an accident. That guy, who recovered from the accident, but is still earless, then becomes infuriated by the slightest slander.":937,"He didn't become pig-headed because of the accident, he lost the emotion of 'trust'. Could be conceivable. I can't say outright that losing a part of the body doesn't cause the mind to lose anything.":938,"But at the very least, [Ishizue] [Arika] fits that case.":939,"The bigger the damage to the body, the bigger the damage to the \nmind.":940,"A left arm's worth of damage, resulted in the complete scraping off of my wits, of my ability to 'feel threats from external factors'. To put it frankly, I've become 'fearless'.":941,"Except, since I'm not missing 'fear', stuff that I think is scary is going to be scary. To be accurate, what I lost was an animal instinct, the defensive mechanism against threats.":942,"According to {i}[Kaie]{/i}, the advantage of this is that I'll be liked by most animals. This is because my caution's been weakened apparently, but I'm not happy at all if I'm liked by lions, tigers, and bears, oh my.":943,"Even if I can't feel threatened, scary stuff is still scary. And, that part in particular makes those animals even more pleased. What the hell.":944,"audio/echo.mp3":945,"{i}Beep, beep, beep{/i}. The cell phone alarm fades into the darkness.":946,"\"Okay. Time's up. I'm going home.\"":947,"A man's got to know when a man's got to leave. I stopped by the factory simply because I was curious. People with low caution will act just out of some stupid curiosity.":948,"Humans are the type that'll walk straight into death if it weren't for signals saying, 'Uh oh, stop, this is dangerous'. Since I can't determine when to pull back without those signals, I have to make definite rules and policies on it.":949,"The rule this time was five minutes. I commanded myself to enter and then go back once five minutes passed, no matter what.":950,"As if nothing happened, I exit the building, leaving the factory behind me. It's obvious that there will be a new urban legend in Shikura City if I ignore it, but I don't like the idea of poking into the bush just to get bitten.":951,"'So don't come here', you might say, but the rules are up because I can't do that.":952,"\"....Though, it is a ghost-story ridden town after all. So who cares if there's an extra one or two haunted broiler buildings.\"":953,"Uh huh, uh huh. There's already plenty of disturbing stories here, like, the family massacre in the mansion, the train of human hands running in the subway, the man-eating delusional housing complex.":954,"I don't think I'll be punished by closing my eyes to one or two potential ghost stories. If there's anything I'm concerned about, it's that there's a ghost spot close to {i}[Tsuranui]{/i}? It should be good enough if I warn her first thing in the morning.":955,"I'm going back to my room. I satisfied my sudden curiosity. I don't want to have anything to do with this demon possession. If I get involved, I'll have to be responsible and be put face to face with some sin I don't want to look at.":956,"I have my hands full just taking care of myself. I can't bear the weight of other people with a sense of justice that's on par with putting a lid over something that stinks. I only have one arm. I'm not smart, either.":957,"A weakling that can't become strong can only get by, by minding his own business as much as possible. After all. No one's going to bail me out if I ever get in trouble, right?":958,"What started this in the first place was the fact that there were no artificial arms that matched me.":959,"My left arm, which had no external wounds, which had no after effects, which was impossible to analyze, which had even been so far as described to have been 'born that way', rejected all prosthetics.":960,"You heard me right. Not doesn't work. Rejected.":961,"Not only the ones that were able to grip and hold by broad muscular movements, but even the ones that were only shaped like arms didn't work. It's a contradiction, but when an arm is fitted, the left arm {i}that I had lost{/i}, hurts.":962,"The doctors judged that it was a psychological after effect. Consciously, I was still denying the current me and keeping my eyes away from the reality that I don't have a left arm.":963,"Since putting on an arm means I'll have to accept that reality, my mind will reject that arm with pain, or some bull like that.":964,"Oh I see, my, that is intriguing, but adding a reason doesn't help. Doesn't matter whether I defy or reject reality, I'm going to need a prosthetic arm. It doesn't even have to be functionally good. I can't relax without both hands.":965,"During my stay, I tested out all the arms in the hospital. Seemingly there had been compatibility issues with the materials, leading to a variety of pain.":966,"There were ones that caused sharp pain, vomiting, even ones that made me lose conscious.":967,"In any case, there'd been differences with each of them. If that's how things are going to be, I'll be patient":968,"-and so I persistently searched for one that worked with me, and the last place I reached was [Karyou] {i}[Kaie]{/i}'s underground chamber.":969,"Looking at me, he said oh-so pleasantly":970,"{i}\"Aahh. That arm had been taken by a fake hadn't it?\"{/i}":971,"And showed me the one arm in the world that matched me.":972,"{i}\"Your arm, [Ishizue]-san, is only missing, but it's still connected to you.

It was true that I didn't think about getting back my left arm. To me, that left arm had never been there. Which was why-":976,"Even if the physical form is gone, a form that had been non-existent from the start won't change.":977,"{i}\"Its sensations are alive. A normal artificial arm, for you, is like wearing clothing on the insides of your body. Of course that would make you so sick as to pass out.\"{/i}":978,"Yes. Even though the corporeal arm was gone, the sensations, and only them, were still there.":979,"I'm talking about images.

There'll be times when existences flows into non-existence, but there's no such thing as non-existence moving existence.":981,"The only things non-existent sensations can touch are the similarly non-existent forms.

Do you like to play musical chairs?\"":2330,"I don't have interest in games like that.":2331,"Even in such a simple game as musical chairs, I never could win. I like watching it instead of playing. I don't want to sit on the chair, and I wasn't admiring those that conquered their seats.":2332,"I was content with just sitting on the floor, watching winners and learning from them.":2333,"\"{i}Stupid...

Can't sit before getting rid of the real one...":2342,"But her concern isn't needed. Because until now I didn't ever want to sit on a single chair.":2343,"Our talk after that became completely like girls'. We talked for almost an hour, and we agreed to meet once a week.":2344,"That said, I get up from the floor.":2345,"\"Oh, by the way, how do you know about me, when you're not leaving here?\"":2346,"\"Ah, that...

White-haired and single-handed guy watches me with his eyes, without a trace of interest on that topic: \"And why is that?\"":2373,"\"Maybe because I can't be allowed to think about myself? I'm very temperamental, so to say. It's hard for me to keep my emotions under control, from the time I was a kid. I get mad, I get depressed, and I can't stop until the reason is gone.":2374,"For example, if I read a sad story, it's getting into me, and I can't get over it myself. The story doesn't solve itself, so I'm depressing until I think of a deconstruction for the plot.\"":2375,"While I was a kid, it didn't bother me, but near the end of grade school I had a personal crisis. My feelings were my greatest enemy, so I had to take the urgent measure of rejecting myself.":2376,"\"Yeah, that's inconvenient. Is that temperamentality congenital?\"":2377,"\"I think I had the roots for it. But it fully bloomed around fifth grade of grade school.":2378,"I don't remember it clearly, but my sister said I saw a ghost and, uh, went loony. So, we lived on a third floor of a cooperative high-rise building. I was standing on a balcony, repeating: Mom, Dad, cool, there's a human burning!\"":2379,"\"Wow, what a story. Was a human burning, uh, still alive?\"":2380,"\"Yes, still alive. It looked like he's supposed to be like that - black from the burns, he was crossing the yard diagonally!":2381,"No, now I can think of some real explanations why did it happen like that. But for me as a child it was a ghost and nothing else.\"":2382,"[Ishizue]-san frowned.":2383,"After his sister became my best friend, I had some regret left. He listened to this story not as to a tale of a sort, but as to a witness's story.":2384,"He made a puzzled face, because he was contemplating the kid that was treated like that.":2385,"And there - adagio.":2386,"Just like on the day we met, lazy music sounds.":2387,"\"──It's time for me to go back. So it's time for farewells. Should we do a handshake, in the end?\"":2388,"I extend my right hand.":2389,"\"No, sorry. My credo is no handshakes.\"":2390,"[Ishizue]-san firmly rejects it.":2391,"He denied the handshake itself, not the handshake with \n[FakeHisaori] [FakeShinya].":2392,"If that's so, there's nothing I can do. Everyone has something they don't like.

You can leave today.\"":2411,"{i}[Mato]{/i}-san stated that and left, saying she's got something to do and that we'll meet soon.":2412,"Woah, wasn't that too easy? I thought some trouble was bound to pile up, but clinic handled it all in a blink of eye. Like a deal in the shop.":2413,"\"Don't you think it all happened too fast, Doctor?\"":2414,"One hour before my discharge, I came to Dr. [Dolittle]'s confessional to say my goodbyes and decided to be soggy for a while.":2415,"\"Isn't that great?

I can understand that, it's enough for living a normal life.":2424,"I heard that if I just start striving for it myself, I'm going to integrate somehow. But... I can't even pretend to. Sounds awfully girlish, doesn't it? [Touma] {i}[Mato]{/i}'s scolding didn't help, so I'm looking for hope in some kind words now.\"":2425,"\"That's a problem. You are going to have to pretend as so...":2426,"But after all, that is nothing else but a motive for human to curb human. Whether one's striving for glory, money, or power, one's doing it because he sincerely wants to be acknowledged by others. \"How successful I am compared to others?\", or, \"I want to show my value\". Get that?\"":2427,"\"I know. But I can't think of it as important.\"":2428,"\"Obviously. You don't even think that you have a value.\"":2429,"Looks like I failed at some point.

I don't perceive them, but he showed me the right direction, clean and clear.":2437,"\"So I have to search for my soulmate of a sort?

No, she's too scary to joke with!\"":3922,"Doc burst out laughing.":3923,"It was worth it.

Let's hope we won't see each other again.":3930,"\"By the way, {i}[Arika]{/i}-kun, did you know? Doctor [Touma], say what you want, can't bear tomatoes.

Incredible mentality - hardly would you imagine a patient discharged from a clinic getting picked up by a cabriolet.":3934,"By the way, clinic's hospital charge was lower than I thought.":3935,"\"Weird\", I say to {i}[Mato]{/i}-san.":3936,"\"That includes your one and half a year's salary.

It's made so that you can move to dorm at any time. If you want, you can do it right now. {w}Yeah, I recommend it.

The blue uniforms and hats suited them well, and they were, as they call them, cops. At the moment, diligently doing a search.":3949,"Getting involved is a pain, but I'd have to live here in a month. How can I not measure the risk? {w}Ah, there, through a bunch of policemen, a man in a Hawaiian T-shirt came my way. This weirdo didn't look like a policeman at all.":3950,"\"Hi. Do you live here?\"":3951,"Hawaiian T-shirt guy - if you look closer, wearing make-up - gazed at me.":3952,"\"Hello? I'm getting in next month. Is it like that here everyday?\"":3953,"\"No, it's not, it's the first time I see something like that.

Aren't you by chance {i}[FakeArika]{/i}-chan's brother? How weird. Different face, but you two seem very much alike.\"":3956,"\"I have a younger sister, but I doubt you mean her.

Why, the guy whose room is being searched, does he have the same name?\"":3957,"\"Wow, your name's completely same?!\"":3958,"Surprised Hawaiian T-shirt guy still examined me and dived into thoughts. Then he said:":3959,"\"Hm-hm... So you're the real one?\"":3960,"\"What? Wow, you're pretty sharp.\"":3961,"\"Ah! Don't flatter me, you silly. I thought {i}[FakeArika]{/i}-chan is weird too.

I'm worried about her too. Though she's not my type.\"":3963,"\"Who knows. If I'm the real one, then she's someone that is not [Ishizue] [Arika].\"":3964,"Finishing Hawaiian T-shirt guy's story: half a year ago a woman came here, calling herself my name, got in a mess and yesterday, finally, disappeared. {i}[FakeArika]{/i} living here half a year ago had, yes, one hand and she was completely like me except for the face.":3965,"\"Weird though. An alias would have gotten discovered right away.\"":3966,"\"Nope, it wouldn't. There are no signs on doors, and after all, are you one of those that dig through new ones' family registers?\"":3967,"Who are \"those\"..?":3968,"\"How about mail? Or guard?\"":3969,"\"Silly you. It's all unformal. My name's {i}[Niijima]{/i}, but most letters come to me by name \"[Flowerie]\". An alias is an alias. And the landlord gathers all the bills from the residents and pays himself.\"":3970,"So it's usual here to use aliases? And a guard here is wacky just like [Niijima]- chan, never meddling in residents' business. Realtors and owners nowadays are rarely familiar enough with residents. And an alias isn't in a way of being friends with neighbors, yeah.":3971,"\"But sometimes there is something still left in notes. Like driver's license or passbook...\"":3972,"Though, if I recall correctly, they're taking away driver's license when you're discharged. And passbooks, well, you don't usually show them to others.":3973,"\"Can I have you for a second? Hey, you, [Ishizue] {i}[Arika]{/i}?\"":3974,"\"Oh crap...\"":3975,"Damn! Questioned by an investigator on the discharge day! It was stupid of me to fool around with [Niijima]-chan.

It appears they already found out both that I wasn't in Shikura until today and that in the room under question was someone using my name as an alias.":3980,"\"Uhh... Yeah, can I ask you a question too..? The one living under my name, who was that?\"":3981,"\"A girl called [Hisaori2] {i}[Makina]{/i}, same age as you. But you know what?

That I'm an ordinary possessed that just watched how her parents die and drove her brother crazy?\"":4179,"\"Yes. Your mind is abnormal, you're possessed, you used your parents to drive your brother crazy. That's all you need to know about Hisaori case.

You, partly from the interest, used the means to exist as means to entertainment.\"":4283,"{i}Never before I thought of anything as fun. I tried to take your place, [Shinya], and it seems to be entertaining.{/i}":4284,"So that's what it was about.":4285,"\"Your imitation was correct because it was a goal in itself.

Bye-bye, {i}[Shinya]{/i}.{/i}":4287,"I admit it.":4288,"I had fun.":4289,"Even when I jumped from the balcony, [Shinya]'s teary face was bringing me delight. {w}As I said myself - when I was put into clinic, it was a punishment for my only sin.":4290,"\"I get it.

If I were mentally healthy, I would've ran away right away, but unfortunately my carefulness circuits are disabled.":4363,"In the middle of a room, there is a curtained bed. Next to it, for some reason, lay a fruit knife.":4364,"\"Yes-yes, it's great that you were able to come here at this late hour. Are you [Ishizue] {i}[Arika]{/i}-san?\"":4365,"Amber eyes look at me from the bed. Their owner, lit by moon, was undoubtedly a beautiful woman.":4366,"\"Ah. Yes, the real one has white hair\", - happily exclaimed the black-haired woman. It's a kid, so a girl.":4367,"A huge beast, looking like a dog - where was it hiding? - noisily sniffing my legs, greeted a new guest.":4368,"\"Good evening. Are you [Karyou]-san? Thing is, I heard you have excellent arm prostheses.\"":4369,"\"Yes, I do. Not so many, but I have some rare ones. They all choose the person though... You're in luck, [Ishizue]-san, looks like they'll fit you fine.\"":4370,"\"Bark bark!\" - cheerfully barked the black dog. Looks like it's good-natured, I thought and froze in place.":4371,"\"Hey──what are you\"":4372,"The owner of a room, laying on bed, wasn't a usual being.":4373,"It wasn't about not having limbs. Every cell inside me turned upside down from a horrible chill.":4374,"Even in clinic I didn't feel such a... threat, coming from the little child before me.":4375,"\"Are you even human..?\"":4376,"It wonderingly opened its eyes. The beautiful face made a smile:":4377,"\"Finally, the image fits. Glad to make your acquaintance, [Ishizue] {i}[Arika]{/i}. My name is [Karyou] {i}[Kaie]{/i}. Hmm, yeah. You can't play a personality with just face alone.\"":4378,"The unknown creature said a weird greeting.":4379,"That's the story about a weirdo I met right after discharge.":4380,"Next is the story about forming a bond with the Underground Devil, a bond that you literally can't cut even with a knife.":4381,"\"And that's what happened, and in the end you came here, {i}[Arika]{/i}.

I don't need it. I just wanted you to think, because [Hisaori2] {i}[Makina]{/i}'s story is important to you. I don't find it interesting at all.\"":4389,"\"I thought you like all possessed.\"":4390,"\"Depends on a scale. You, for example, wouldn't like a steak that is less than two hundred gramm weight, right?

Are you envious of [Hisaori2] {i}[Makina]{/i}?\"":4404,"{i}[Kaie]{/i} mysteriously smiles, and looks at me. Ugh. I'm used to it, but I still get nervous. Don't scare me! {i}It{/i}, even though it's so attractive that I'm at loss of words, is still a guy, god damn.":4405,"\"No. I just thought about how she strained everyone. And anyway, what's with that imitation stuff. You need to see other people's lives, and that's it. No need to think about it all the time.\"":4406,"[Hisaori2] [Makina] doesn't pass for a possessed.":4407,"People have enough problems on their own.":4408,"People remember only the superficial details about others, and can't even think about what's going on inside. And they don't need to.":4409,"She, on the other hand, caught everything about others in precision. [Hisaori] [Shinya], with his persistence, made his own \"imagining and replay of someone else's life\", while she was doing it subconsciously, monster.":4410,"Hypertrophied imagination, so to say. That's why she was obsessed with all those sticky ideas like \"nothing works out well\". Everything for her worked out fine, balancing to a zero. Big successes had big failures to contrast, a healthy life, actually.":4411,"Even though she doesn't realize it, she was probably a perfect girl for everyone in her childhood. Her main mistake wasn't the possession and not even the intellect she was born with.":4412,"There is \"being liked by everyone\", and there is \"doing everything so that as many people as possible wouldn't love you\". These two are completely opposite ways of life, and she thought they are the same...":4413,"\"Good for you. Hum, hum. From that quality of yours I feel uneasy.\"":4414,"\"And I'm uneasy from your formulations like those.\"":4415,"I don't want to get into Niijima-chan's league":4416,"I don't want to see that face, having fun using others, okay?":4417,"Look at him, all amused.":4418,"\"If you're so good, {i}[Arika]{/i}, then I have a question for you. If you were ever to imitate anyone, why would it be?\"":4419,"Is he mocking me? He didn't ask \"who\", he asked \"why\".":4420,"\"Who knows. I didn't ever try it... Well, probably out of admiration or trying to be the same?\"":4421,"Becoming an original - it's, you know... [Hisaori2] [Makina] was always surrounded by fake smiles, that's why she tried to become the original one.":4422,"\"Nah. If you wanted to become original one, the talk would be easier. I'm just talking about when it's enough to become like someone. No need to especially imitate.\"":4423,"So it's not about the admiration? That means...":4424,"\"Ahh... Too lazy to think for yourself, so you act like someone else?\"":4425,"So he's talking about when you don't want to think for yourself. When you're mechanically copying someone.":4426,"\"Yes. That was the true essence of [Hisaori2] {i}[Makina]{/i}. She was thoroughly thinking about someone else's life, and in result she stopped thinking.\"":4427,"\"Probably\", he continued, \"her thinking worked the opposite way. We with you move though our lives, changing all sorts of priorities in our mind. Compare it with a car. And she begins with a spring start. That which will require years for us, she thinks about at first, and then starts to move.":4428,"For example, imitating [Hisaori] [Shinya]. Every morning she starts a thinking spring named \"[FakeHisaori] [FakeShinya]\" for just some minutes, and then she continues playing another person. If you talk about an energy that is used for that, even among possessed she's one of the best. If she used it correctly, she could do anything she wanted.\"":4429,"\"I don't get it. What's the point of doing that?\"":4430,"\"Like I said - {i}she's only thinking to be able to stop thinking{/i}. Like a real wind-up mechanism.

Are you always that heartless?\"":4453,"\"Why would I want to get familiar? \"I just can't live otherwise\", it isn't funny. All your system is upside down.
