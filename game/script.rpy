    "I'd been making my way into the home of a neighbor, someone I've seen around the block a few times, a Kizaki-san. {w}At seven o'clock, when the sun had set, without pushing the door bell or saying anything, I snuck in through the front door."




    "Nah, I was going to smash a window to get in, but luckily it wasn't locked. Careless schmuck. Now, see that? That makes me look like some punk thief. Problem was, I couldn't say it was off the mark at all."



    "Just one month ago, on the night of September 12. I had illegally entered the residence like a burglar because I wanted money."


    nvl clear

    "Apparently, there had been a family suicide at Shikura Hill. The guy who was informed about it had been an officer at a nearby police \nbox. {w}There'd been a phone call from the head of the Kizaki household, the first thing in the morning, or so they say."




    "{i}\"Last night, the three of us, me, my wife, and my daughter, committed suicide by wringing our necks rather pleasantly. It would very much be appreciated by me if you take care of the mess as soon as possible. I certainly don't want to inconvenience the neighbors.\"{/i}"




    nvl clear

    "Bad joke. But unfortunately for the officer receiving the call, he didn't have the sense to figure out what part of that he was supposed to laugh at and headed straight to the Kizaki residence, \nthen {i}blam{/i}. {w}Never heard from again."



    "Ditto for the other officer that came by looking for his partner when he didn't come back past noon."


    "The police box at Block 2 of Shikura Hill became an empty husk for half the day and news of this strange incident spread before the police department even got word of it."



    "'Course, it's not the kind of stuff that would make its way on the air waves since it is just local, but really it's just gossip among people living around the area."



    nvl clear

    nvl clear

    "Gossip like that crept gradually throughout town, eventually reaching the sharp ears of the lovers of the curious, sometime after 2 pm. Apparently they shared the news with me, and there had been phone calls in the afternoon."



    "Don't remember the stupid details of the conversation, but the time is definitely there on the call history."


    nvl clear

    "As of 6:40 pm, there had been 2 calls before the sun had set from a TSURANUI and KARYOU KAIE. Don't care about the {i}[Tsuranui]{/i} one but the {i}[Kaie]{/i} call?"



    "That's a problem."

    "There's something ominous just by getting a phone call from an oddball that loves cell phones but hates making phone calls."


    nvl clear

    "And so, it's a little before 7:00 pm. After the sun had set, there had been a third phone call. The number of the caller didn't show up on the display. I waited a little before I answered the phone."



    "What was to be said couldn't be any simpler."

    "The man told me his name was Kizaki, gave me his address, and said,"

    "{i}\"I'm very sorry. I'm tired so I want you to exorcise me.\"{/i}"

    nvl clear

    "Then he hung up after giving me that very sorry-sounding line. {w}What I really wanted to do was forget about it and go back to sleep, but there were three reasons why I couldn't ignore him."



    "Number 1. The massive amount of memos on my desk. Probably advice from {i}[Kaie]{/i}, detailing the events today of the Kizaki family suicide."


    "Number 2. The address of Kizaki-san's that I just heard. Shikura Hill, Block 2, 4-7, that's only three houses away from me. Shit."


    "And number 3. I happened to have the luck to still have {i}[Kaie]{/i}'s arm today."

    nvl clear

    "Anyhow, it refers to those psychologically crippled that are unable to control their own emotions. It's a name with only symptoms and no pathogens, so you might think, y'all don't be inventing some disease when you're just loony."

    "If the stuff in someone's head becomes 'off' in comparison with everyone else, it's not because the mind's sick, it's because there is something wrong in the body. Human beings are made up of mystery, wonder, and a solid design schematic."

    "People can accept the bizarre utterances that are made if it's because a demon's responsible for them. If there's a demon inside, that'd account for their nearly non-human behavior, too, from their point of view."



    "Still, ego transference to an artificial personality coming from that type of possession state died out a long time ago. I'll add that the personas that the people in this country wear are generally going to be that of beasts too."

    "You could fall apart any day, the people around you could break any day - you'd feel secure thinking that way wouldn't you, that you're safe because you're ready for self-ruin? I guess people are numbing themselves with a defensive screen that's giving them that kind of mistaken thinking."

    "But, the big problem isn't in the theoretical. It's that it causes real harm. Demon possession does exist. The people that have it really are mentally ill. And, they are 'super humans' like Kizaki that threw away their humanity."



    "These last few years, the number of abnormal crimes has been increasing. Most of the time, these incidents are passed off as being just another demon possession crime."

    "The public might be aware of demon possessions, but they're totally unaware, under the real meaning, of what demon possession is."


    nvl clear

    "A part of the reason why the name demon possession stuck. It isn't because of the incomprehensible behavior of those afflicted. It is simply because they exerted abilities that humans don't have."



    "There are things that don't escape from the realm of delusion, as well as things that are treated on the same level as mental defects. However, there are cases where it crosses that line and becomes 'super human'."




    "Like say, a human that doesn't die when he rotates his head and, on top of that, hurts other people. But yeah, I suppose it is natural for people to think that's impossible unless a contract with the devil's been made."

    "I still can't acknowledge them and I probably never will for the rest of my life. Even if 100 Kizakis come after me, I will stubbornly laugh them off."


    "...Still, there is something preventing me from dismissing it as nonsense. There is a reason why I, despite being able to write it off as lies, can't quash it as false."

    "\"No, not that. I had enough of the demonology sermon. I don't care about the truth of the current demon epidemic. I'm asking why people get possessed by demons.\""

    "If the body works that way, then so does the mind. {i}[Arika]{/i}, when it comes down to it, you're a kind person. I know you can't tolerate it when the weak are pushed around for being weak, but this is a fact. Demons only possess people that had already been weak.\""

    "\"Yes, weak people will be hit by demon possession. But that isn't because they're emotionally weak, but rather, the 'environment' around them has weakened. Even if the heart lies in the inside, it fluctuates according to external factors."




    "Family issues; relationship with the friends, the Other; evaluation of Self in society. If the footing is poisoned, naturally, the person standing on it'll also be infected."



    "The mind then becomes sickened and that person becomes unable to adapt to normal society. This is an example of the environment not being built by us, but changing us."



    "And taking of advantage of that, the supernatural infests the just-weakened mind.\""

This is just a preventive measure to deal with their pessimism, but with demon possession, they'll actually commit suicide."




    "'I'm sad so I want to die, but I'm scared of death.' That's the balance of a normal person. But these people are different. 'I've had enough of feeling sad, so I have to die.' There is a total lack of fear of the future."



    "The really scary people are the ones that no longer care about their past and future and can only see 'the present.'\""


    "\"...Can only see the present, huh? If people don't think about tomorrow, that leaves everything up for grabs. If there's only a today, then it's fine to do anything in the present.\""



    nvl clear 

    "Which would mean dying tomorrow isn't anything to get all upset about. If there's anything they're scared of, it's being anything but what they are in the present. "



    "\"So while us normal people have hesitations towards dying and anger at living, they're the opposite?\""


    "\"Yes, that's right. For people with nothing but the present, it's as if they'd just been born. They'll feel that everything around them is tinged with uncertainty. It's not as if they can't put the brakes on their emotions."



    "People with emotional wounds, people that are liable to be possessed by concepts, are living beings that really can't go on living without a 'rule they judged for themselves.'"


    "Emotions won't break them, but they'll destroy themselves just by breaking a delicate rule that holds no meaning to anyone but themselves. It's easy for the supernatural to take hold in a heart on the brink.\""

    "The hell. After coming up with that kind of stupid rule, they get possessed by a demon when they break it, then turn into mass-murderers?"

    "Displeased at something, the face reflecting in the mirror twists in hatred. Must have been because of some nasty stench. The black dog comes by me and crouches in content. The dog's getting friendlier with me by the day. Uh oh."



    nvl clear

    "\"Haha, of course you wouldn't. That's how normal people think after all. But just hear me out. In this case, you don't blame the weakness of the heart, but you should think about what made it weak.\""



    "\"This is how the stock phrase should be. It won't be, 'Feel shame in the weakness of your fragile heart!'. It'll be, 'Know the sorrow of the fragility of man!'\""


    "{i}[Kaie]{/i} talks as if to pity them. He spreads his hand in exaggeration under the shadow of the canopy ever so courteously. But it's nothing more than a gesture. He doesn't possess the natural emotion of being able to feel sorrow."

    "Out of some mistake, he accidentally drinks the tap water and then commits suicide, even though nothing unusual happened to his body. Saying that's weak is the vanity of the strong."



    "After all, I don't have the courage to die just from drinking water. It's a feeling that the average Joe won't get, but can't you say that people that kill themselves for some stupid reason are psychologically strong to the point of madness? But, yeah, still."



    "Nope, the fact is that I can't even slightly deny that they're the weaklings of society."

    nvl clear

    "Abnormal secretion of normally harmless neurotransmitters will turn them into agonistic poison, devastating the receptors, and warping the condition of the human body."

    "{i}[Kaie]{/i} speaks. He says that they're both sicknesses in which the body can no longer be controlled by emotions. It's an issue of adding or subtracting, and both anorexia and compulsive overeating are means of weight control that went off course."




    nvl clear

    "Anorexia and bulimia are conditions where fear is learned in eating itself, and the stomach becomes unable to accept food."


    "Compulsive overeating, however, is what happens when they \"couldn't\" become thinner, out-of-control stress that gets taken out on food. People who become fatter no matter how hard they try will have this."



    "Just as anorexics don't see anything wrong with their thin and weakly bodies, the compulsive overeaters, while thinking that they don't want to see their fattened bodies, that they want to die, will continue eating food from that stress."
